Sudoku project done in x86 .TASM using DOSBOX

This project was done as part of my course requirement for CSC 21000: Assembly Language

In DOSBOX make sure the directory where this sudoku.asm file is located is mounted as your main directory Once inside the right directory run the following commands:

## tasm sudoku.asm : turns the source file into an object file with .obj extension
## tlink sudoku /t : turns the .obj into a .com which is an application file ready to be executed.
## Now type in the filename: sudoku <-- and the code should run
if you do not want to go through the hustle of running the file the gif below shows how this code works.
